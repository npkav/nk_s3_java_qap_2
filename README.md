### 5. Rate the difficulty of each question  
I would rate the difficulty of each question as follows:  

- **Problem 1: Easy**  
  I found this problem to be fairly straightforward and I was able to complete it without any major issues.  

- **Problem 2: Medium**  
  I found this problem to have similar code to problem 1, but with more advanced math involved. I had to do a bit more trial and error to get the correct output.  

- **Problem 3: Medium**  
  I found this problem to be fairly simple in retrospect, but the wording of the problem was a bit tricky to follow at times, leading to a bit of confusion.  

I feel fairly confident in solving similar problems to these in the future.
