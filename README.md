1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)
    This assignment took me roughly 10 hours to complete.


2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)
    Aside from our lectures, I used the following resources:
        - Stack Overflow
        - W3Schools
        - ProgrammingWithMosh Java Course
        - freeCodeCamp Java Course
        - Codecademy Java Course


3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)
    I spoke to Evan Kavanagh about the project a few times to clarify some of the concepts.


4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?
    I did not need to reach out to my instructors for this assignment.


5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.
    I would rate the difficulty of each question as follows:
        - Problem 1: Easy
            I found this problem to be fairly straightforward and I was able to complete
            it without any major issues.

        - Problem 2: Medium
            I found this problem to have similar code to problem 1, but with more
            advanced math involved. I had to do a bit more trial and error to get the
            correct output.

        - Problem 3: Medium
            I found his problem to be fairly simple in retrospect, but the wording of the
            problem was a bit tricky to follow at times, leading to a bit of confusion.

    I feel fairly confident in solving similar problems to these in the future.
